# Great Health Clinic

This is a database for a fictional clinic where the doctor/owner wanted a way to manage data efficiently. BUILT using PostgreSQL.  So far at this milestone we have been able to:
- Make use of Entity Relational Diagrams to initially map out the database before creating in our repository.


Enjoy!

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Git clone https://github.com/soulemanou-software/health-care-database.git
- cd health-care-database

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

## Built with

- PostgreSQL
- Linux terminal
